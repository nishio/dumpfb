# dumpfb
Dump your all Facebook Activity logs

It was a node-webkit app, but does not work with new NW.js .

I put a script to run on pure browser on script.js .



## old document (as node-webkit app)

- drop this folder to node-webkit
- log in Facebook, open activity log, click 'dump' on the node-webkit's menubar
- then activity.txt will be generated
